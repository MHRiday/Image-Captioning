# Image Captioning
This is the second project of Computer Vision nanodegree from Udacity. Here we have combined CNN and RNN knowledge to build a network that automatically produces captions, given an input image.
## Data-set
In this project, we have used Microsoft COCO (MS COCO) 2014 dataset. It contains 164k images split into training (83K), validation (41K) and test (41K) sets.

## Tool Used
- PyTorch
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
